# Everleigh Voice AI - Project Status Summary

## Current Status

Everleigh Voice AI is now configured for self-hosting with the following components:

### Backend Infrastructure

- **MongoDB:** Self-hosted database for persistent storage
  - Database indexes created for performance optimization
  - Proper authentication and security measures implemented
  - Data partitioning and TTL indexes for automatic cleanup

- **n8n Workflow Automation:**
  - Self-hosted instance configured with MongoDB integration
  - Workflow templates created for:
    - Weather information retrieval
    - Calendar integration
    - Reminder system
  - Systemd service setup for reliable operation

- **LiveKit Server:**
  - Containerized deployment using Docker
  - Configured for real-time audio/video communication
  - Optimized for low-latency voice interactions

### Network Configuration

- **Nginx Reverse Proxy:**
  - SSL termination with Let's Encrypt certificates
  - WebSocket support for LiveKit and real-time features
  - Proper security headers and configurations
  - Rate limiting at the application level

### Performance Optimizations

- **Caching Layer:**
  - Server-side caching with node-cache
  - Function-level caching for database operations
  - Cache invalidation for data mutations

- **Database Optimizations:**
  - Indexes on frequently queried fields
  - Compound indexes for complex queries
  - TTL indexes for automatic data cleanup

### Security Enhancements

- **API Rate Limiting:**
  - Different tiers based on endpoint sensitivity
  - IP-based and token-based rate limiting
  - Protection against brute force attacks

- **Credentials Management:**
  - Secure storage of API keys and secrets
  - Role-based access for different services
  - Proper authentication for all endpoints

## Next Steps

### 1. Integration Testing

- Verify MongoDB performance with cache layer under load
- Test n8n workflows with real requests in production environment
- Monitor system resources during testing
- Validate rate limiting and security measures

### 2. Workflow Customization

- Customize the n8n workflow templates for specific use cases
- Add specialized workflows for daily routines and tasks
- Create error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Implement notification system for workflow results

### 3. Voice Model Enhancements

- Fine-tune voice models for better recognition
- Implement speech enhancement for noisy environments
- Add acoustic echo cancellation for improved call quality
- Consider local speech-to-text models for reduced latency

### 4. Memory System Implementation

- Design a long-term memory system using MongoDB
- Create summarization workflows for conversation history
- Implement vector storage for semantic search capabilities
- Add context management for multi-session continuity

### 5. Monitoring and Analytics

- Set up system monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana
- Create custom dashboards for service health
- Implement user interaction analytics
- Add error tracking and alerting

### 6. Backup and Recovery

- Create automated backup procedures for MongoDB
- Design a disaster recovery plan
- Implement log rotation and management
- Document recovery procedures

## Resource Utilization

Current resource utilization for self-hosted components:

| Component | CPU | Memory | Disk | Network |
|-----------|-----|--------|------|---------|
| MongoDB   | Low | ~2GB   | ~5GB | Low     |
| n8n       | Low | ~500MB | ~1GB | Low     |
| LiveKit   | Medium | ~1GB | ~500MB | Medium |
| Nginx     | Low | ~200MB | ~100MB | Medium |

## Maintenance Schedule

- **Daily:** Check logs for errors and warnings
- **Weekly:** Review system performance and resource utilization
- **Monthly:** Apply security updates and patches
- **Quarterly:** Review and optimize database performance

## Documentation

All self-hosting components are documented with:
- Installation scripts in `scripts/` directory
- Configuration templates for each service
- Testing procedures in `scripts/test-deployment.sh`
- Backup and recovery procedures (to be implemented)

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **LiveKit UDP Ports:** Requires a range of UDP ports to be open (50000-50100) for WebRTC traffic
2. **MongoDB Memory Usage:** May need to adjust WiredTiger cache size based on available memory
3. **n8n Resource Usage:** Can spike during complex workflow execution
4. **SSL Certificate Renewal:** Requires periodic renewal through Let's Encrypt

## Conclusion

Everleigh Voice AI is now ready for self-hosted deployment with optimized performance, security, and reliability. The next steps focus on further refinement, monitoring, and extending the system's capabilities through custom workflows and improved voice interaction models.
